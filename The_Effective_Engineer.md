# The Effective Engineer (by Edmond Lau)

#### Part 1: Adopt the Right Mindsets

**Focus on High-Leverage Activities**

* **Use leverage to measure your engineering effectiveness.** Focus on what generates the highest return on investment for your time spent (_Leverage = Impact produced / Time invested_).

* **Systematically increase the leverage of your time.** Find ways to get an activity done more quickly, to increase the impact of an activity, or to shift to activities with higher leverage.

* **Focus your effort on leverage points.** Time is your most limited asset. Identify the habits that produce disproportionately high impact for the time you invest.
